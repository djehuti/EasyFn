# EasyFn

## Description

This is an app that lets you automatically toggle the function keys
as function/special keys on a Mac.

## This software is unmaintained; No warranty is provided

It hasn't been updated since December 2016 at the very latest, so
it probably doesn't work on any more recent OS.

I do not plan on updating this code.

## License

I am releasing this code to the public domain (see [LICENSE]()).

This **does not include** the file [relaunch.m](), which contains
an attribution notice at the top regarding [its source][ced].

In [a comment][comment], the author says:

## Acorn

The `.acorn` files are from an old version of [Acorn][].
The latest version can probably still read them.
